promise-ops
===========

A couple of operators on promises that I found myself using in more than one project.

I needed this in several of my private projects so I decided to extract it as a library.

Installation
------------

```
npm install promise-ops
```


Usage, Features, API, wtf...?!
------------------------------
Please refer to the [test suite](./spec/utils-p-spec.coffee).
